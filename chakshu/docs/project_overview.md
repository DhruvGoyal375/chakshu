# Project Overview

## Mission Statement

**Chakshu** is dedicated to making Wikipedia accessible to blind and visually impaired users by transforming complex web content into structured, screen-reader-friendly formats through advanced AI and accessibility-focused design.

## The Problem We Solve

Wikipedia contains vast amounts of human knowledge, but much of it remains inaccessible to visually impaired users due to:

- **Complex visual layouts** with tables, images, and mathematical content
- **Unstructured content** that's difficult for screen readers to navigate
- **Visual elements** like charts, diagrams, and images without proper descriptions
- **Mathematical equations** in LaTeX format that can't be read by text-to-speech systems

## Our Solution

Chakshu addresses these challenges through:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Accessibility-First Design**
Every feature is designed with screen readers and text-to-speech systems in mind, ensuring content is properly structured and navigable.

### ðŸ¤– **Advanced AI Integration**
- **Qwen2.5-VL vision model** for detailed image descriptions
- **Playwright-based table capture** for complex data visualization
- **LaTeX-to-text conversion** for mathematical content
- **Chemical notation processing** for scientific articles

### ðŸ”„ **Intelligent Content Processing**
- Structured content extraction with proper heading hierarchy
- Parallel processing for performance optimization
- Smart caching to reduce load times
- Error handling and graceful fallbacks
