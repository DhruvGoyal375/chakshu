# API App (`api`)

The `api` app in the Chakshu project primarily serves as a routing and namespacing layer for the various API endpoints provided by the application.

## Responsibilities

* **API URL Aggregation**: It groups API-related URL patterns from other apps under a common prefix (e.g., `/api/`).
* **Versioning (Potential)**: While not explicitly shown, an app like this is often used to implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`).
* **Global API Configuration (Potential)**: Could house middleware or settings specific to the API, although most of this seems to be handled at the project level in `chakshu/settings.py`.

## Key Files and Components

* **`urls.py`**:
    * This is the most important file in the `api` app based on the provided information.
    * Its `urlpatterns` include URL configurations from other apps:
        ```python
        from django.urls import include, path

        urlpatterns = [
            path("", include("core.urls")),
            path("", include("scraper.urls")),
        ]
        ```
    * This means that any URLs defined in `core.urls.py` and `scraper.urls.py` will be accessible under the path where `api.urls` is itself included (which is `/api/` as defined in `chakshu/urls.py`).
    * For example, if `core.urls` has `path("search/", ...)`, the full path becomes `/api/search/`.

* **`views.py`**:
    * The provided file structure lists `api/views.py`.
    * It's possible this file is empty or contains minimal views if the app's primary role is routing.
    * Alternatively, it could contain high-level API views, such as an API root view that lists available endpoints, or views related to API-wide concerns like authentication if that were managed here.

* **`models.py`, `admin.py`, `apps.py`, `tests.py`**:
    * These are standard Django app files.
    * `models.py`: Unlikely to contain significant models if the app is purely for routing, but could be used for API logging or metadata.
    * The other files would serve their standard purposes.

## How It Fits In

1.  A request comes to the Django project (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/search/?q=test`).
2.  The main `chakshu/urls.py` matches the `api/` prefix and passes the rest of the path (`search/?q=test`) to `api.urls`.
    ```python
    # chakshu/urls.py
    urlpatterns = [
        path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
        path("api/", include("api.urls")), # <--- Match
    ]
    ```
3.  `api/urls.py` then tries to match the remaining path. In this example, `path("", include("core.urls"))` would delegate the `search/` part to `core.urls.py`.
4.  `core.urls.py` finally matches `search/` to `SearchResultsView`.

## Development Considerations

* **Clarity of Routing**: Ensure that the includes in `api/urls.py` are clear and don't lead to ambiguous or conflicting URL patterns.
* **API Versioning**: If the API is expected to evolve significantly, consider implementing a versioning strategy using this app (e.g., by creating sub-namespaces like `path("v1/", include("core.v1.urls"))`).
* **Minimal Logic**: Generally, an app dedicated to API routing should contain minimal business logic itself, delegating that to the apps providing the actual features.
